# AI Pentad: From World to Embodied Intelligence

Explore AI as a living ecosystem, evolving from **World AI** to **Embodied AI**—five layers of emergence and agency.

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **World AI** | 1st principles: understanding the raw environment, global data, and foundational patterns. |
| **Perception AI** | Inputs from the world: senses, sensors, and data ingestion pipelines. |
| **Agentic AI** | Ritualistic tasks: repetitive workflows, automation, and disciplined execution. |
| **Generative AI** | Creative, inspired: synthesis, extrapolation, and innovation within constraints. |
| **Embodied AI** | Integrates and idealizes: systemic reasoning, co-adaptation with humans, ethical outputs. |
