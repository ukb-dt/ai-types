# AI [Pentad](https://ukb-dt.github.io/ai-types-00/)[:](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7vrd8k4eo) From World to Embodied Intelligence

[Explore AI](https://ukb-dt.github.io/who-03-ideal-rate/) as a living ecosystem, evolving from **World AI** to **Embodied AI**—five layers of emergence and agency.

| Layer             | Description                                                                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Embodied AI**   | Integrates and idealizes: systemic reasoning, co-adaptation with humans, ethical outputs.  |
| **[Generative](https://ukb-dt.github.io/alpha/) AI** | Creative, inspired: synthesis, extrapolation, and innovation within constraints.           |
| **Agentic AI**    | Ritualistic tasks: repetitive workflows, automation, and disciplined execution.            |
| **Perception AI** | Inputs from the world: senses, sensors, and data ingestion pipelines.                      |
| **World AI**      | 1st principles: understanding the raw environment, global data, and foundational patterns. |

- No standard classification exists at the moment
- But ours is rooted in the [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topology) of [engineered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartsfield%E2%80%93Jackson_Atlanta_International_Airport) systems (*TOES*)
- We find this `O)-(O` in plants, animals, and man
   -  `O)-Tree-(O`
   -  `O)-Lungs-(O`
   -  [O)-Airports-(O](https://ukb-dt.github.io/o-atl-o-who/)
