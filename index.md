# AI [Pentad](https://ukb-dt.github.io/ai-types-00/): From World to Embodied Intelligence

Explore AI as a living ecosystem, evolving from **World AI** to **Embodied AI**—five layers of emergence and agency.

| Layer             | Description                                                                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Embodied AI**   | Integrates and idealizes: systemic reasoning, co-adaptation with humans, ethical outputs.  |
| **Generative AI** | Creative, inspired: synthesis, extrapolation, and innovation within constraints.           |
| **Agentic AI**    | Ritualistic tasks: repetitive workflows, automation, and disciplined execution.            |
| **Perception AI** | Inputs from the world: senses, sensors, and data ingestion pipelines.                      |
| **World AI**      | 1st principles: understanding the raw environment, global data, and foundational patterns. |

- No standard classification exists at the moment
- But ours is rooted in the topology of intelligence found in nature
- We find this `O)-(O` in plants, animals, and man
